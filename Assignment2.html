<h1>Phases of Chess</h1>
<p>A game of chess is divided into three parts: the opening, middlegame, and endgame.
Each phase has its own characteristics and general strategies, though of course there is 
no clear dividing line between phases.</p>
<div></div>
<h2>Opening</h2>
<p>The opening is the beginning of the game. Generally, players are improving their pieces,
and there is less direct interaction. The middle of the board is less crowded, with pieces mostly
on their starting sides. The opening sets up the strategy of the middlegame. </p>

<div></div>
<h2>Middlegame</h2>
<p>The middlegame often seems like the most complex phase. Most pieces are out, the
middle of the board is filled, and pieces are interacting directly. There are many tactics 
and attacks.</p>
<div></div>
<h2>Endgame</h2>
<p>The endgame comes, of course, at the end of the game. As many pieces have between
taken, there is more space. Kings become more active without the threat of immediate checkmate.
Despite the lack of pieces, the endgame is still complex - there are many squares to move to,
and the tiniest details can make the difference.</p>
